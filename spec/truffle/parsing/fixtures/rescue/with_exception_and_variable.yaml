description: "with exception and variable"
notes: >
  The rescue branch is represented as a RescueClassesNode node
  that contains a list of exception classes.
  
  A local variable is represented with the following simplified AST:
  
    (WriteLocalVariableNode frameSlot = 2
      (ReadGlobalVariableNodeGen name = $!
        (LookupGlobalVariableStorageNodeGen name = $!)))
  
  that is equivalent to:
  
  ```ruby
  error = $!
  ```
