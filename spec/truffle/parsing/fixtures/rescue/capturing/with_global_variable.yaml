description: "capturing / with a global variable"
notes: >
  A global variable capturing is represented with the following simplified AST:
  
    (WriteGlobalVariableNodeGen name = $error
      (ReadGlobalVariableNodeGen name = $!
        (LookupGlobalVariableStorageNodeGen name = $!)))
  
  that is equivalent to:
  
  ```ruby
  $error = $!
  ```

  begin
    "foo"
  rescue RuntimeError => $error
