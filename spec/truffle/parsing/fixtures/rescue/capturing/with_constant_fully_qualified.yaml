description: "capturing / with a fully qualified constant (::A)"
notes: >
  A constant capturing is represented with the following simplified AST:
  
    (WriteConstantNode name = ERROR
      (ObjectClassLiteralNode)
      (ReadGlobalVariableNodeGen name = $!
        (LookupGlobalVariableStorageNodeGen name = $!)))
  
  that is equivalent to:
  
  ```ruby
  ::Foo::ERROR = $!
  ```

  begin
    "foo"
  rescue RuntimeError => ::ERROR
