description: "capturing / with a constant with fully qualified lexical parent (::A::B)"
notes: >
  A constant capturing is represented with the following simplified AST:
  
    (WriteConstantNode name = ERROR
      (ReadConstantNode name = "Foo"
        (ObjectClassLiteralNode))
      (ReadGlobalVariableNodeGen name = $!
        (LookupGlobalVariableStorageNodeGen name = $!)))
  
  that is equivalent to:
  
  ```ruby
  ::Foo::ERROR = $!
  ```
focused_on_node: "org.truffleruby.language.exceptions.TryNode"

  begin
    "foo"
  rescue RuntimeError => ::Foo::ERROR
